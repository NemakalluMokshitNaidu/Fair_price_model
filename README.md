2.1 Building the Fair Value Model: The project kicks off with the construction of a Fair Value Model, a cornerstone in currency valuation. The BEER concept, derived from macroeconomic indicators and relative price levels, forms the backbone of this model. Utilizing time-series data and econometric techniques, the model quantifies deviations from equilibrium exchange rates, offering an in-depth understanding of currency dynamics.
2.2 Systematic Value Trading Strategy: Delving into the realm of trading strategies, the project formulates a systematic approach for the USDINR currency pair. The strategy capitalizes on Z-score values, a measure of standard deviations from the mean. These values offer insights into overbought and oversold conditions, forming the basis for systematic trading decisions.
